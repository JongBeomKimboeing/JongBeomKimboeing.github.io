# About me

Neo-HPSTR Jekyll is a responsive and modern blog template.

# Jong Beom Kim

You can see it running [here](http://blog.rhesoft.com/) and [here](http://aronbordin.com/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/).


## Getting Started

Neo-HPSTR takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require Jekyll 2.x and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.
